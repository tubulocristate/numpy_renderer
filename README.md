# numpy_renderer
It is numpy-only implementation of a standard rendering pipeline. It is designed to be as fast as possible in Python (no for loops are used), but it is far from being usable when one tries to render more than 1K faces. <br > 
Simple cube rendering and rendering a model from obj file are presented as jupyter notebooks in **examples** directory.
